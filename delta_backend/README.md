# ü©∫ FHIR to Flat JSON Conversion Engine

This project is designed to convert FHIR-compliant JSON data (e.g., Immunization records) into a flat JSON format based on a configurable schema layout. It is intended to support synchronization of Immunisation API generated data from external sources to DPS (Data Processing System) data system

## üìÅ File Structure Overview

| File Name              | What It Does |
|------------------------|---------------|
| **`converter.py`**     | üß† The main brain ‚Äî applies the schema, runs conversions, handles errors. |
| **`conversion_layout.py`** | A plain Python list that defines which fields you want, and how they should be formatted (e.g. date format, renaming rules). |
| **`delta.py`** | Holds the function called by AWS Lambda |
| **`extractor.py`**     | Tailored functionality to extract target fields from immunization record received by the delta handler. |
| **`exception_messages.py`** | Holds reusable error messages and codes for clean debugging and validation feedback. |
| **`log_firehose.py`** | Firehose logging functionality. |
| **`utils.py`** | Holds utility functions. |

## Setting up the delta lambda locally
Note: Paths are relative to this directory, `delta_backend`.

1. Follow the instructions in the root level README.md to setup the [dependencies](../README.md#environment-setup) and create a [virtual environment](../README.md#) for this folder.

2. Replace the `.env` file in the `delta_backend` folder. Note the variables might change in the future. These environment variables will be loaded automatically when using `direnv`.
    ```
    AWS_PROFILE=
    DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=
    IMMUNIZATION_ENV=
    SPLUNK_FIREHOSE_NAME=
    AWS_SQS_QUEUE_URL=
    DELTA_TABLE_NAME=
    SOURCE="local"
    ```

3. Run `poetry install` to install dependencies.

4. Run `make test` to run unit tests or `make coverage-run`. To see the unit test coverage, run `make coverage-run` first and then `make coverage-report`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- Schema-driven field extraction and formatting
- Support for custom date formats like `YYYYMMDD`, and CSV-safe UTC timestamps
- Robust handling of patient, practitioner, and address data using time-aware logic
- Extendable structure with static helper methods and modular architecture

---

## Example Use Case

- Input: FHIR `Immunization` resource (with nested fields)
- Output: Flat JSON object with 35 standardized key-value pairs
- Purpose: To export into CSV or push into downstream ETL systems

## ‚úÖ Getting Started with `check_conversion.py`

To quickly test your conversion, use the provided `check_conversion.py` script.
This script loads sample FHIR data, runs it through the converter, and automatically saves the output in both JSON and CSV formats.

### üîÑ How to Use It

1. Add your FHIR data (e.g., a dictionary or sample JSON) into the `fhir_sample` variable inside `check_conversion.py`
2. Ensure the field mapping in `conversion_layout.py` matches your desired output
3. Run the script from the `tests` folder:

```bash
python check_conversion.py
```

### Output Location
When the script runs, it will automatically:
- Save a **flat JSON file** as `output.json`
- Save a **CSV file** as `output.csv`

These will be located one level up from the `tests/` folder:

```
/mnt/c/Users/USER/desktop/shn/immunisation-fhir-api/delta_backend/output.json
/mnt/c/Users/USER/desktop/shn/immunisation-fhir-api/delta_backend/output.csv
```

### Visualization
You can now:
- Open `output.csv` in Excel or Google Sheets to view cleanly structured records
- Inspect `output.json` to validate the flat key-value output programmatically
