    ## Overview
     
    Use this API to access a patient's immunisation record. It is part of the [Vaccinations Data Flow Management](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/vaccinations-data-flow-management). It is intended to extend and replace [Immunisation History - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/immunisation-history-fhir) and existing [Vaccination](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/vaccination) flows. 

    ### You can:
     
    - create and record a patient immunisation `yet to be released`
    - search for a patient's immunisation records
    - get the details of an immunisation record
    - update an immunisation record `yet to be released`
    - identify an immunisation record as entered in error `yet to be released`
     
    ### You cannot use this API to:
     
    - retrieve the immunisation record of multiple patients at once
    - record or update a patient's demographic details
    > To get demographic details from the [Personal Demographics Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service), use the Personal Demographics FHIR API.
     
    You can create, read, update and delete:
     
    - Vaccination events for the disease types found in this list {To be confirm}
      
    ### Data availability, timing and quality
 
    This is a real time service, constrained by the time taken for providers to transfer vaccination events. In most cases the latest a record will be available is within 48 hours of the immunisation event.
 
    The API search interaction will only return immunisation records based on a traced NHS number. Other interactions require the immunisation ID assigned by the API to interact with individual records for read, update and delete.

    The vaccination events for all disease types are limited to vaccinations administered on behalf of NHS England.
 
    There is a limited scope of data validation upon receipt of the data. Whilst the data is generally of a good, reliable quality, consumers must be aware data is shared as received and users should consider the risk of potential absences or inaccuracies of the data. 

      
    ## Who can use this API 
    This API can only be used where there is a commercial, legal and clinical basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development.
   
    You must demonstrate you have a valid use case as part of digital onboarding. As this service is disease type agnostic, there is also a shortened onboarding process for each disease type, to explain the legal, commercial and clinical justifications. 
   
    You must do this before you can go live refer to the [Onboarding](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/immunisation-fhir-api#overview--onboarding).
   
    ## Who can access immunisation event records
     
    Health and care organisations in England can access immunisation records.
   
    Legitimate direct care examples include NHS organisations delivering healthcare, local authorities delivering care, third sector and private sector health and care organisations, and developers delivering systems to health and care organisations.
   
    A future capability will be to enable patients who receive health and social care or make use of NHS services in England to access their vaccination records.
   
    The immunisation event records captured via the API are used for a number of purposes including (some uses include distribution of the data by means other than this API)
     
    - supporting a patient getting a vaccination
    - supporting patient managing their immunisation health
    - identifying those to be invited to vaccination nationally
    - identifying those to be invited to vaccination locally
    - supporting the booking of a vaccination appointment
    - supporting the payment reconciliation process on behalf of NHS England / NHS Business Services Authority
    - supporting measuring the overall success of a vaccination campaign to help inform the success of the [NHS Vaccination Strategy](https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/nhs-vaccination-strategy/)
  
    ## API status and roadmap
    This API is [in development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses).
     
    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?tag=immunisation).
     
    If you have any other queries, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).
     
    ## Service level
    This API will be a platinum service, meaning it is operational and supported 24 x 7 x 365.
     
    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).
     
    ## Technology
     
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).
     
    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except that it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.
     
    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which conform to [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), specifically [fhir.r4.ukcore.stu2](https://simplifier.net/packages/fhir.r4.ukcore.stu2).
     
    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, and use US spellings, for example `/Immunization` not `/immunisations`
    - array names are singular, for example `entry` not `entries` for address lines
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object
     
    There are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.
     
    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).
     
    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).
     
    ## Security and authorisation
     
    This API has a single access mode:
    - application-restricted access

    In the future we intend to offer user-restricted access. 
     
    ### Application-restricted access
     
    This access mode is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis), meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.
     
    To use this access mode, use the following security pattern:
    - [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)
 
    Access may be restricted to certain functionality based on your user need

    ## Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

    * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server

    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.

    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
    * is for early developer testing
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
    * is stateless, so does not actually persist any updates
    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

    For details of sandbox test scenarios, or to try out the sandbox using our 'Try this API' feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * is for formal integration testing
    * is stateful, so persists updates
    * includes authorisation, with options for user-restricted access (with or without [smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers)) and application-restricted access     
    
    For read-only testing, we will provide an Immunisation records test pack soon.

    To test creating, updating and deleting patient vaccination events, you must set up your own test data.

    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).
 
    ## Onboarding
      
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API.
    We call this onboarding.
    The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it is worth planning well ahead.
  
    Whilst this API is in Alpha it is not possible to onboard to this API.
    As part of this process, you need to demonstrate that you can manage risks and that your software conforms technically with the requirements for this API.
    Information on this page might impact the design of your software.
  
    To understand how our online digital onboarding process works, see [digital onboarding](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/digital-onboarding#using-the-digital-onboarding-portal).

         ## Overview
         Use this interaction to record the administration of a vaccination.  The immunization resource must include a targetDisease(s) matching the 'disease types' enabled in this interaction and represented by the correct SNOMED concept(s) for that 'disease type'. See another page for details and disease types and coding.  
         You must be authorised for the create interaction and the disease type associated with the vaccination event in order to submit a new record.

        ## Overview
        Use this interaction to search for a patient's vaccination records using their NHS number and DiseaseType. You can request the patient's vaccination history for one or more specified 'disease types'. You may limit the vaccination records by specifying date criteria, for example if you only need to know about vaccinations administered in the last 12 months. 
        Vaccination event details may be obfuscated for sensitive information. The response will not include contained resources for patient or practitioner within each immunization resource it returns. A single, separate patient resource will be included in the bundle and referenced by each immunization. 
        Vaccination events submitted without an NHS Number will not be available for retrieval via this interaction. Also, where a patient has a change of NHS Number some or all records may be unavailable via this interaction for a short period of time whilst records are updated. 
        You must be authorised for the search interaction and the disease type(s) specified in your search in order to access the records.

        ## Overview
        This interaction allows you to retrieve the record of a single vaccination by our assigned id. We will return the full immunization resource as submitted, except vaccination event details may be obfuscated for sensitive information. 
        The response will include an eTag for the version of the record which has been returned. If you intend to update a record, it is recommended that you use this interaction to obtain the latest version (and eTag for the version). 
        To retrieve a full vaccination history for a patient, see the search interaction. 
        You must be authorised for the read interaction and the disease type associated with the vaccination event in order to access the record.

        ## Overview
        This record allows you to add a new updated record of a vaccination event. Update replaces the full immunization resource, so you must provide all data fields, not just the change (Patch is not currently supported). You may obtain all the current data for the vaccination event using the read interaction, which will also return an eTag for the version. 
        You may use update to re-instate a deleted record, but our update interaction does not support creating a new vaccination event where one does not currently exist. 
        You must not change the identifier when updating a vaccination event. The identifier is used as a primary identifier by downstream systems.  
        You must be authorised for update interaction and the disease type associated with the vaccination event in order to update the record.

        ## Overview
        This endpoint allows you to mark a record that has been entered in error.
        Deleted records will continue to be stored for a period of time but are not returned in response to read or search requests.
        A deleted record can be re-instated using the update interaction if it was incorrectly deleted.

              May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.
