    ## Overview

    Use this API to access the Immunization Fhir service.

    ## Who can use this API

    Health and care organisations in England and the Isle of Man can access
    Immunization fhir records. Legitimate direct care examples include NHS
    organisations delivering healthcare, local authorities delivering care,
    third sector and private sector health and care organisations, and
    developers delivering systems to health and care organisations. 


    Patients who receive health and social care or make use of NHS services in
    England, Wales, the Isle of Man, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Channel
    Islands.

    Immunization History API

    ## API status and roadmap

    This API is in development.

    ## Service level

    To be completed.

    ## Technology

    This API is
    [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).


    It conforms to the
    [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir)
    global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4
    (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except that it does not support the
    [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.


    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just
    RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.

    In particular:

    - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/Patient` not
    `/patients`

    - array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines

    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR
    global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object


    There are [libraries and SDKs
    available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks)
    to help with FHIR API integration.

    ## Network access

    To be completed.

    ## Security and authorisation

    This API has three access modes:

    - application-restricted access

    - healthcare worker access

    - patient access


    The end user could be:

    * a healthcare worker - in which case you must ensure they are authenticated
    and suitably authorised locally

    * a patient - in which case you must ensure they are authenticated locally

    * not present at all - for example as part of a back end process to check
    NHS numbers for data flowing from one system to another


    ## Errors

    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded
    or not. They are usually in the range:


    * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an
    API that needs to wait for further action

    * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application

    * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server


    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under
    Response. See our [reference
    guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes)
    for more on errors.
