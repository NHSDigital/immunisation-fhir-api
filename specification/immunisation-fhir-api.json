      "description": "## Overview\n \nUse this API to access a patient's immunisation record. It is part of the [Vaccinations Data Flow Management](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/vaccinations-data-flow-management). It is intended to extend and replace [Immunisation History - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/immunisation-history-fhir) and existing [Vaccination](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/vaccination) flows. \n\n### You can:\n \n- create and record a patient immunisation \n- search for a patient's immunisation records\n- get the details of an immunisation record\n- update an immunisation record \n- identify an immunisation record as entered in error \n \n### You cannot use this API to:\n \n- retrieve the immunisation record of multiple patients at once\n- record or update a patient's demographic details\n> To get demographic details from the [Personal Demographics Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service), use the Personal Demographics FHIR API.\n \nYou can create, read, update and delete:\n \n- Vaccination events for the disease types found in this list {To be confirm}\n  \n### Data availability, timing and quality\n\nThis is a real time service, constrained by the time taken for providers to transfer vaccination events. In most cases the latest a record will be available is within 48 hours of the immunisation event.\n\nThe API search interaction will only return immunisation records based on a traced NHS number. Other interactions require the immunisation ID assigned by the API to interact with individual records for read, update and delete.\n\nThe vaccination events for all disease types are limited to vaccinations administered on behalf of NHS England.\n\nThere is a limited scope of data validation upon receipt of the data. Whilst the data is generally of a good, reliable quality, consumers must be aware data is shared as received and users should consider the risk of potential absences or inaccuracies of the data. \n\n  \n## Who can use this API \nThis API can only be used where there is a commercial, legal and clinical basis to do so. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development.\n\nYou must demonstrate you have a valid use case as part of digital onboarding. As this service is disease type agnostic, there is also a shortened onboarding process for each disease type, to explain the legal, commercial and clinical justifications. \n\nYou must do this before you can go live refer to the [Onboarding](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/immunisation-fhir-api#overview--onboarding).\n\n## Who can access immunisation event records\n \nHealth and care organisations in England can access immunisation records.\n\nLegitimate direct care examples include NHS organisations delivering healthcare, local authorities delivering care, third sector and private sector health and care organisations, and developers delivering systems to health and care organisations.\n\nA future capability will be to enable patients who receive health and social care or make use of NHS services in England to access their vaccination records.\n\nThe immunisation event records captured via the API are used for a number of purposes including (some uses include distribution of the data by means other than this API)\n \n- supporting a patient getting a vaccination\n- supporting patient managing their immunisation health\n- identifying those to be invited to vaccination nationally\n- identifying those to be invited to vaccination locally\n- supporting the booking of a vaccination appointment\n- supporting the payment reconciliation process on behalf of NHS England / NHS Business Services Authority\n- supporting measuring the overall success of a vaccination campaign to help inform the success of the [NHS Vaccination Strategy](https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/nhs-vaccination-strategy/)\n\n## API status and roadmap\nThis API is [in development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses).\n \nTo see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?tag=immunisation).\n \nIf you have any other queries, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).\n \n## Service level\nThis API will be a platinum service, meaning it is operational and supported 24 x 7 x 365.\n \nFor more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).\n \n## Technology\n \nThis API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).\n \nIt conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except that it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.\n \nIt includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which conform to [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), specifically [fhir.r4.ukcore.stu2](https://simplifier.net/packages/fhir.r4.ukcore.stu2).\n \nYou do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.\nIn particular:\n- resource names are capitalised and singular, and use US spellings, for example `/Immunization` not `/immunisations`\n- array names are singular, for example `entry` not `entries` for address lines\n- data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object\n \nThere are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.\n \n## Network access\nThis API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).\n \nFor more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).\n \n## Security and authorisation\n \nThis API has a single access mode:\n- application-restricted access\n\nIn the future we intend to offer user-restricted access. \n \n### Application-restricted access\n \nThis access mode is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis), meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.\n \nTo use this access mode, use the following security pattern:\n- [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)\n\nAccess may be restricted to certain functionality based on your user need\n \ncontact:\n  \n  name: Immunization-fhir-api API Support\n  \n  url: 'https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support'\n  \n  email: api.management@nhs.net\n\n## Errors\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:\n\n* 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action\n* 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application\n* 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server\n\nErrors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.\n\n## Open source\n\nYou might find the following [open source](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#open-source) resources useful:\n\n| Resource                  | Description                                                          | Links                                                                          |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Immunisation FHIR API     | Source code for the API proxy, sandbox and specification.            | [GitHub repo](https://github.dev/NHSDigital/immunisation-fhir-api/) |\n| FHIR libraries and SDKs   | Various open source libraries for integrating with FHIR APIs.        | [FHIR libraries and SDKs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) |\n| nhs-number                | Python package containing utilities for NHS numbers including validity checks, normalisation and generation. | [GitHub repo](https://github.com/uk-fci/nhs-number) \\| [Python Package index](https://pypi.org/project/nhs-number/) \\| [Docs](https://nhs-number.uk-fci.tech/) |\n\nWe currently don't have any open source client libraries or sample code for this API.

A phased rollout will then release further interactions and types of vaccination records.\n\nTo understand how our online digital onboarding process works, see [digital onboarding](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/digital-onboarding#using-the-digital-onboarding-portal).\n"

You can request the patient's vaccination history for one or more specified 'disease types'. You may limit the vaccination records by specifying date criteria, for example if you only need to know about vaccinations administered in the last 12 months. \n Location related data items are included. Patient location sensitivity indicators (such as flags for sensitive patient records) should be obtained by connecting systems from the [Personal Demographics Service (PDS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service) and used to apply data filtering as appropriate. The response will not include contained resources for patient or practitioner within each immunization resource it returns. A single, separate patient resource will be included in the bundle and referenced by each immunization. \nVaccination events submitted without an NHS Number will not be available for retrieval via this interaction. Also, where a patient has a change of NHS Number some or all records may be unavailable via this interaction for a short period of time whilst records are updated. \nYou must be authorised for the search interaction and the disease type(s) specified in your search in order to access the records. \n\n## Sandbox testing\nYou can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:\n\n| Scenario                                | Request                                                                                                                                                         | Response                                                                |\n| ----------------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                         |                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                         |\n|  Immunisation history found             | `patient.identifier`=`https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-number\\|9000000009`                                                                                            | HTTP Status 200 with immunisation data in response body                 |\n|  Bad Request                            | Didn't pass Required fields `patient.identifier`  or  `-immunization.target`          | HTTP Status 400 Bad Request               |\n",
